                WER 2022 invites submissions in the field of Requirements

                  Papers presenting original results on research, teaching and
                  industrial viewpoints on all aspects of Requirements
                  Engineering are welcome. The selection process will consider
                  applicability and relevance to Requirements Engineering,
                  originality, and clarity. The paper should not exceed 14 pages
                  according to the LNCS format.

                  Submissions for the Software Requirements Tool track must
                  include a paper and a demo video with audio comments. The
                  paper must have at most 10 pages, formatted according to the

                  The paper should not exceed 7 pages of content for Master's
                  work and 10 pages of content for Doctoral work, according to
                  the LNCS page format. We recommend, although it is not
                  compulsory, that the research is at an intermediate stage so
                  that expertsâ€™ suggestions could be included in the MSc and PhD
                  work. The works will receive feedback from the Program
                  Committee with questions and suggestions about its content.
                  The author should use these comments in the preparation of the
                  paper's final version. Selected works must be presented by
                  students during the MDT. On this occasion, they will receive
                  opinions and constructive criticism from a Guest Panel,
                  composed of researchers in the field of Requirements
                  Engineering, as well as the audience.

                  of the conference and accepted in journals to present their
                  research at WER. This is an opportunity for the authors to
                  discuss their work in order to obtain feedback and improve
                  their research. Journal manuscripts eligible for submissions

                  The manuscript must have not been presented at any other
                  conference as a journal first contribution and it must report
                  completely new research results or a novel contribution that
                  significantly extends previous research. At least one author
                  per selected submission must register and attend the
                  conference. Submissions must contain: paper title, authors and
                  affiliation, keywords, journal, DOI, and an extended abstract
                  (or summary). The submission should be formatted according to
